# the average reward over 50 test episodes being 21037 and over 100 test episodes being 23553
# indicates that the trained ddpg agent performs consistently well in the lunar lander continuous environment
# the higher average reward with more test episodes suggests that the agent’s policy generalizes effectively
# across different runs and conditions
# this improvement can be due to the agent’s ability to learn smooth and stable control strategies over training
# the ddpg’s actor-critic architecture with continuous action outputs allows it to optimize the landing maneuvers effectively
# resulting in higher cumulative rewards over time
# variability in shorter tests might lower average rewards but with more episodes the estimate becomes more reliable
# and shows the agent’s true competence

# i did not use the requested noise in the original problem because the environment version v3 of lunar lander is discrete
# this forced us to adapt by not applying the continuous noise or by handling actions differently to fit the environment’s action space
